# Computer Systems Automated Design - Practical Tasks and Coursework

## Repository Overview

This repository contains practical tasks and coursework instructions for the "Computer Systems Automated Design" course. The tasks focus on hardware and software design, emphasizing automated systems and game development. I will work on individual tasks for the implementation of the rock paper scissors game and a configuration in XML format
## Task Details

### General Instructions:
1. All software used in tasks must be under a free license.
2. I will use **Arduino nano** for this task.

### Game Development Requirements:
1. Projects should be simple games developed using hardware and desktop software.
2. Configuration and state saving should follow the format described in **Table 1**.
3. The server component of the game should run on hardware, while the software will act as the client.

#### Play Modes:
- **Man vs AI**
